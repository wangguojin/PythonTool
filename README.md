# PythonTool
python scripts small tool for game resources. 
when i use unity3d to make games,some effects need the photoshop to handle the images,but i'm not familiar with PS exactly.
so,sometimes i need the script to help me,and it's more fast.
I will put scripts into different directory by different function.and I will append this with my rest of time.
1.BlendTextures
   function:put four images into one image's r,g,b,a channel to a blending tga texture.
   support : png,jpg,jpeg...(you can add another if PIL supports the format)
